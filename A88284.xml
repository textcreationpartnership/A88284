            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>TS now above two yeares since I was first resolved to fall upon the examination of an extravagant Prophecy then published, cryed up and vented under the name of <hi>Paul Grebner;</hi> a corrupt and purely false Copy it was, dispersed into the severall Shires of this Nation by Men very subtile, but of indifferent good esteem where they lived, purposely to stir up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against this <hi>State;</hi> the pretty Brat was hugg'd, bragg'd of, esteemed highly, and People made beleeve the Thing was as Canonicall as any thing of that nature could be, or the <hi>Presbytery</hi> make it; however, it well fitted the humour of those times in <hi>1648.</hi> when <hi>Hamilton</hi> with his wretched Army was upon his March towards <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>1650. The future History of Europe</hi> comes forth: A Booke penned subtilly, the maine scope of it tending to make good, that the present

               </gap>h <hi>Prophecies</hi> as these were very graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and kindly accepted by the <hi>Scotish Saints;</hi> indeed they were so; and good reason; the opinion of this <hi>Tom</hi> namelesse Author agreed to a thred with the <hi>Presbyterian Treasons</hi> then hatching and on foot against our present <hi>Parlament.</hi> I know all that ever this <hi>Anonimus</hi> writes or forges, and makes us beleeve he fetches from obscure <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts</hi> concealed in clandestine <hi>Libraries,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, held Catholicke, &amp;c. and all this to terrifie the Ʋulgar from assisting the present Authority.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Anglicus</hi> expected some able Pen or other would have vindicated the <hi>Parlaments</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor herein, and have unfeather'd this <hi>Jack Daw,</hi> such especially who have more leasure and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then he; Behold, men generally were running into an opinion that the forged Prophecies before mentioned were reall, else they must have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Answer. This puts <hi>Anglicus</hi> into a passion, to see the Parlament dishonored, and none take up the
<pb facs="tcp:171407:3"/> Bucklers in their Defence, which in effect might signifie their Cause not worth own ng; besides, an impudent prick-eard Presbyterian Priest, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters me one day; <hi>Now</hi> Lilly, <hi>what say you Mr.</hi> Merlinus <hi>unto</hi> Charles <hi>the Son of</hi> Charles <hi>the present</hi> Scotish <hi>King; heele pull the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels out of White-Hall by the eares;</hi> after <hi>a</hi> little modest scolding, the Man was calme, and I promised silence as to his name, &amp;c.

            <p>I may justly say, <hi>Utilius fuerat nobis nescire futura:</hi> For had my knowledge been lesse, Envie had never attended me so close at the heeles, or slander or Calumny wounded me so sore; were my person and actions equivalent to reports, I should appear a Monster not a Man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may see what their peevish invectives and vaine challenges have obtained at my hands, <hi>viz.</hi> a free and ingenuous opening of all <hi>Prophecies</hi> which are authenticall; all of which cry downe their <hi>Diana, viz. Monarchy;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:171407:4"/> and not one <hi>Prophecie</hi> is for the standing of their <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>

And that he might be sure to countenance his owne opinion, and receive no contradiction in what he publisheth, he affirmes beforehand in his <hi>Epistle</hi> that he quotes strange Auhors and Bookes, and such as are not to be seen in every <hi>Library.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I beleeve he speaks truth; for his <hi>Authors</hi> I conceive lived in <hi>Ʋtopia,</hi> and their Books, or such as he mentions to be theirs are no where to be seen or heard of but in <hi>Terra incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> The whole scope of that his Booke being nothing else, but a slovingly casting dirt upon the honour and Actions of this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> and a meere invention to deceive and cheat the World, and especially the <hi>English</hi> Commonwealth, in asserting out of his forged Prophesies, <hi>That</hi> Charles <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Scottish King is the Lyon of the North,</hi> so frequently Prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and that <hi>he and he onely shall erect the fift universall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and that</hi> England <hi>shall be under a Monarchy untill Doomes day, and that the present</hi> Charles <hi>shall doe wonders, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I shall orderly relate the Authors own words, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Fallacies and abuses offered unto the whol Nation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171407:8"/> in pretending and producing forged <hi>Prophesies</hi> instead of true ones. In pag. 1. lin. 18, 19, 20. he saith, <hi>We have gained no more by our Civill Wars,</hi>

                     <hi>then instead of one Tyrant to advance a dozen over us; and from the height of our former liberty to run up the broad way to the height of slavery.</hi> In the first place we see he confesseth the late King to be a Tyrant: secondly,<note place="margin">The late King confessed to be a Tyrant.</note> he puts a great aspersion upon the honour and proceedings of the Parliament: I hope they will take such honourable Courses hereafter amongst themselves, and with their Sub Committees in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that no viperous Pen may take occasion in the future to blemish their justice or well mannaging the Publique affaires of this Nation; and that we of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as we have equally shared in the burthens and misfortunes of the worst of times, may in the end be more then Adventurers, if not reall possessors of what hath been already or shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obtained by our Swords and Purses, <hi>viz.</hi> Publique Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>In his second Page he writes, <hi>That the fift and last universall Monarchy of the Gospell of Christ upon Earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A fift univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Monarchy.</note>
                     <hi>shall begin in the year of our Lord</hi> 1710.

Let us then looke into the improbability of this Mans Conjecture and assertion; the present <hi>Scottish</hi> King is this 29 of <hi>May</hi> 1651. fully 21. years of age; if we consider what his age may be in the year 1710. we shall finde it thus:<note place="margin">Age of the <hi>Scottish</hi> King at present.</note>
                     <hi>Natus</hi> 1630. which substracted from 1710/1630. there remains 80. From hence we may conclude that the Author intended the <hi>Lyon of the North</hi> or the present King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> shall take possession of his fift <hi>Monarchy</hi> when he is full fourscore years of age.

                  <p>In his fourth leafe, the preceding <hi>Anonymus</hi> mentions the <hi>Comet</hi> in 1618. and tels us of a Conjunction of ♄ and ♃ the 18. <hi>July</hi> 1618. which cannot be; for ♄ was then in ♉, ♃ in ♐: the effects whereof, saith he, <hi>Are not confined unto Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many onely, but are fore-runners of the downfall of the Sodomiticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Society of</hi> Jesuites, <hi>the extirpation of all Kingdomes and free States of Papists,</hi> (these are the Authors words) and onely to make way for the <hi>Lyon of the North</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyon of the North.</note> in the Ashes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and this Lyon is the present <hi>King of Scotland: Risum teneatis amici.</hi> I onely unto this give this Answer, That in the year 1618. there was no such Conjunction of ♄ and ♃; therefore all this Mans events and predictions derived from that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conjunction are vaine and idle, for the Learned doe well know, there being no cause no effects could possibly follow. I perceive this Author is very lame in this as in all other his Proofes, and so I beleeve we shall finde him: perhaps he had the calculation of this Conjunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> which he saith was in 1618. in some obscure Library, or in such whereof he gave us an hint in his Epistle, that so we should not track him. The Parliament and Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> may well adventure all the whol difference in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion upon the Truth thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> if there were a Conjuction of the two superiors in 1618. we will yeeld and lay downe our Cause,<note place="margin">The true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was <hi>July 1623.</hi>
                     </note> but if no such Conjunction then was or in five years after, let our enemies be ashamed of their forgeres. This Author shal give us leave to make use of our own reason and understanding, and that assures us the Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:171407:9"/> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which he would have us take notice of, was really the seventh of <hi>June</hi> 1623.</p>
                  <p>In the same fourth leafe he produces a Prediction of <hi>John Baudensis</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baudensis.</note> verbatim thus rendred by himselfe; <hi>There shall happen in these our Europeian Regions, the destruction of great Emperours, the slaughter of People, funerals of Kings, subversions of Commonwealths, mutations of Monarchies, massacres of Princes and illustrious Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, violent and proud Counsels, treasons and rebellions amongst Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Clergie men shall finde a change of Lawes and Ecclesiasticall constitutions by those of greater power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The end why this Prophecy was forged.</note>
                     <hi>and an insatiable desire of new things among common people. The Northerne parts of Europe shall be greatly oppressed with Warre, Sicknesse and Pestilence; rich men shall be impoverished, Princes cast out of their Dominions; the Fathers shall be banished, and after a long space of trouble,</hi> their Children shall be restored to their former Condition. <hi>This Comet also threatneth the terrible ruine of</hi> Rome, <hi>and burnings in all the Cities of</hi> Europe. <hi>The Papisticall Clergie, especially the Cardinals, shall be cast downe from their dignities; the Jesuites shall every where be drawne to death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He intends the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>neither shall the</hi> Spaniards <hi>or</hi> French <hi>men have courage to save their necks from the halters. Furthermore, we discerne a Kingdome to arise of the most ancient Inhabitants in the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>which to Christians shall be a Miracle, and to the World a terrour; and these shall obtaine the revolution of a new Empire, under which shall be administred uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall gladnesse, joy and delight to Mankinde,</hi>

                     <hi>the Wicked being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where taken away. All these things shall be effected by a certaine</hi> Northern King, <hi>who shall miraculously establish Peace, Religion and Security throughout the whole World, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre he produces the Prediction, or as himselfe will have it, the Prophecy of <hi>Baudensis;</hi> and he conceives, if it be not <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> yet it far exceeds <hi>Astrologicall</hi> ones.

                  <p>These Verses were a Prophecie of King <hi>James</hi> and his Issue, <hi>Charles</hi> the late King was his first issue, and he began the Wars, <hi>Charles</hi> the present King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and his Brethren are those he cals the next issue.

                  <p>In the next place, he delivers us for a very Truth, that the Conjunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> 1683. shall

                     </note> All which he would prove out of these words: <hi>And the Stone which smote the Image became a great Mountaine, and filled the Earth.

That place intends the spirituall reigne of Christ upon Earth, and dispersing the Gospell of Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver most parts of the World. <hi>In his</hi> 28. <hi>page, he will have us to understand, that he must not be a Moyses</hi> of the Jewes blood, <hi>but a Captaine from the North, who shall restore the Jewes, and worke the workes of God in righteousnes, and make peace, and like a mighty stream overflow the whole Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot understand how this Lyon of the North, or this man greater than <hi>Charles</hi> the great, can burn Cities, Men, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp;c. devoure all with the Sword, and yet after that be said to performe the workes of God in righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>In page 29. he mentions a <hi>Northerne Monarchy that shall arise from the Northern Sea, and pitch his Tents in the Ashes of the Easterne and Western Monarchies.</hi>

                  <p>It seems this Lyon of the North must be a great Traveller, whilst he trots from East to West to conquer Kingdomes, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Countries. <hi>Dic &amp; eris mihi magnus Apollo, In quibus, &amp;c. viz.</hi> In what Countrey shall this great <hi>Alexander</hi> be born, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:171407:22"/> of the most High:</hi> Wee must acknowledge that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied very truly; for the Scripture, against whose evidence there is no Appeal to bee made, confirmes it: But if <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> loved the wayes of unrighteousnesse, and laboured with that continued infirmity of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Priesthood. viz.

               <p>If God Almighty, in those times of so great darkenesse or <hi>Heathenisme,</hi> did not leave some Kingdomes destitute of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetique spirits, though the true causes by which they did prophecy, lye concealed unto posterity, or are manifested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very few at present living, shall wee now thinke that in the purest tymes of <hi>Christianity,</hi> God either hath been or is lesse mercifull then unto former ages hee was, or that hee is not as able or willing to infuse into some Christians the spirit of Prophecy as into some Heathens of old.

Some affirme she had that foresight of his conditions from a stranger, who had not onely great judgement in Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171407:42"/> but in the more secret learning; others that one <hi>English</hi> a <hi>Scott</hi> informed her thereof first.<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Ann</hi> of the Palsgrave.</note> Queen <hi>Ann</hi> may be thought to have the spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi> in judging so rightly on her Son and Daughter; for she so much scorned and undervalued the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> for a Husband unto the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that in most of her language after and before the marriage, she would call her <hi>Goodwife Palsgrave,</hi> a name and title she thought good enough for any Woman should marry that dull and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Man; and indeed her feares and predictions proved most true. The old <hi>Scotish</hi> Lady his Nurse was used to affirme as much, and that he was of a very evill nature even in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and the Lady, who after tooke charge of him, cannot deny it, but that he was beyond measure willfull, and unthankfull; Yet while he was young,<note place="margin">

               </note> insomuch as under him they grew first insolent, and then saucy; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his indulgence unto them did in part procure unto himselfe the peoples hate. Whether his indulgence unto the <hi>Clergy,</hi> proceeded from a religious affection rather to advance the wayes of righteousnesse or <hi>Gods</hi> cause, than his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate designes, it hath been by many controverted; but by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men adjuged, that his owne <hi>Selfe-ends</hi> were therein more sought after than Propagating the <hi>Gospell;</hi> so that he served himselfe by pretending to advance the <hi>Clergy:</hi> He erred extreamly in this one businesse, when divers godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in <hi>Norfolke</hi> delivered him a Petition against the Tyrant <hi>Wrenn</hi> their <hi>Bishop,</hi> he sent for <hi>Wrenn,</hi> and bad him answer it.<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Wrenn</hi> a pestilent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> Novelties in Doctrine he hated as much as in Ceremony. He loved not greatly the antient <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Gentry</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but did rather prefer <hi>Creatures</hi> of his owne or Fathers making. How much he loved any of the <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Gentry,</hi> but for his owne ends, he made it plainly appeare at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he procured sundry of the <hi>English Nobles,</hi> and many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> Members of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> to recede from the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and convene at <hi>Oxford</hi> where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was; and after, that this Mock <hi>Parlament</hi> to satisfie his desire had convened and assembled, done what they could, and thereby engaged their Persons and Estates for him,<note place="margin">The King abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the <hi>Nobles.</hi>
               </note> yet because they would not in all things comply with his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall humour, in a letter of his unto the Queen, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of them unto her, and sayd, he was so troubled with a <hi>Mungrell Parlament,</hi> he could do nothing, &amp;c. This scornfull Epithite or Badge of disgrace, was all the reward any of those unfortunate <hi>Gentlemen</hi> had from him; but it was just they should be so payd their wages, that in so trayterous a way deserted the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which sitts to this day, &amp;c. He cared not much for the <hi>Common-Law,</hi>

               </note> or very much for the <hi>Long Gown</hi> men; he learned that disaffection of his from

               <note place="margin">Likely to prove a Tyrant.</note> he would have proved the greatest Tyrant the <hi>English</hi> Nation ever had to rule over them, and therefore they did still pray for a reconcilement betwixt <hi>Parlament</hi> and <hi>Him,</hi> but could never indure to heare he should conquer our Armies, &amp;c.

He had a naturall imperfection in his speech,<note place="margin">Defect in the <hi>Kings</hi> speech.</note> at sometimes could hardly get out a word, yet at other times he would speak freely and articulatly; as the first day of his comming before the <hi>high Court of Justice,</hi> where casually I heard him, there he stammered nothing at all, but spoke very distinctly with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171407:44"/> much courage and magnanimity. As a Man he had his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, for he was very covetous and gripple,<note place="margin">He was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</note> and sparing of his treasure, (qualities nothing commendable in a King) &amp; if at any time liberall, it was rather to the undeserving or boysterous fellowes than well meriting; by how much the more humbly any made their adresses unto him, by so much the more was he imperious, lofty, and at a distance with them; whereupon it most an end happend, that the <hi>impudent</hi> and <hi>bold</hi> were rewarded, and the <hi>vertuous</hi> slighted,<note place="margin">Rewarded the vicious.</note> which imperfection of his inforced a bold spirited <hi>Courtier</hi> to say, there was no way to get any Boon from him, but by impudence and <hi>Cajo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> him with unbeseeming language. Yet he himselfe was never obscene in his speech, or affected it in others. I have onely met with or taken notice of two passages, which argue him guilty of unbeseeming language; first, in all or most of his letters unto the Queen, he tearmes the <hi>Parlament Rebells,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Called the <hi>Parlament</hi> Rebells.</note> though they were Lawfully convened, and not dissolved or to be dissolved without their owne consent; but time and their <hi>Victories</hi> acquainted him with more civill language, and taught him to style them a <hi>Parlament.</hi> In an other Letter of his unto her, he calls the Lord Generall <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who was then the <hi>Parlaments</hi> Generall, their <hi>Brutish</hi> Generall; a most unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Terme and Epithite to bestow upon so brave a Man, so civill, so valiant, and so much a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as <hi>Fairfax</hi> was and is; assuredly the <hi>Progenitors</hi> of the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> were <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Abuses the Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
               </note> and of good estates, then and at what time the <hi>Ancestors</hi> of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> were but poore <hi>Stewards</hi> unto a family in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and what a preferment it is now, or was some three hundred yeares since to be <hi>Bailiff</hi> or <hi>Steward</hi> unto a <hi>Scotish</hi> Family, let the whole World judge, for this was the true originaIl of the rise &amp; growth of the Family of <hi>Stuarts</hi> and no other,<note place="margin">Rise of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
               </note> though since by marriage they came to be Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as their owne Chronicles relate.) He did not greatly Court the Ladyes, nor had he a lavish affection unto many; he was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well fitted for Venerious spoarts, yet rarely frequented illicite Beds; I do not heare of above one or two naturall Children he had, or left behind him. He had exquisite judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <note place="margin">Judgment in <hi>Physiognomy.</hi>
               </note> to discover the vertuous from the wanton; he honored the vertuous, and was very shye and choice in wandring those wayes, &amp; when he did it, it was with much cautiousnesse and secrecy; nor did he prostitute his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but unto those of exquisite persons or parts; and this the Queene well knew; nor did she winke at it. Hee had much of <hi>Selfe-ends</hi> in all that he did,<note place="margin">A selfe-ended Man.</note> and a most difficult thing it was to hold him close to his own promise or word; he was apt to recede unlesse something therein appeared compliable either unto his owne will, profit or judgement; so that some foraigne Princes bestowed on him the Character of a most false Prince,<note place="margin">Ill Characters of him.</note> and one that never kept his word unlesse for his owne advantage. Had his judgment been as sound as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was quick and nimble, he had been a most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and though in most dangerous results and extraordinary serious consultations and very materiall, either for State or <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A uncertain <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </note> he would himselfe give most solid advise and sound reasons, why such or such a thing should be so, or not so; yet was he most easily withdrawne from his owne most wholesome and sound advice or resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with as much facility drawne on inclined to embrace a farre more unsafe and nothing so wholesome a Counsell. He would argue <hi>Logically,</hi> and frame his arguments <hi>Artificially;</hi> yet never almost had the happinesse to conclude or drive on a designe in his owne sence, but was ever bafled by meaner capacities.<note place="margin">His feares of a <hi>Parlament.</hi>
               </note> He feared nothing in this World, or disdained any thing more than the Convention of a <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the very name was a <hi>Buggbeare</hi> unto him; he was ever refractory against the summoning of a <hi>Parlament,</hi> and as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would embrace an opportunity to break it off; this his aversnesse being well knowne to some grave Members, they contrived at last by witt &amp; the necessity of the times, that his hands were fast tyed up in granting a Trienniall sitting,<note place="margin">Grants a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enniall <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
